# COVIDdata
personal data science/coding project using covid data.


This repository is for a personal project of mine, as a way of showcasing my skills.

This is version 1.0.0
So far the project involves using Python to extract data from the web (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties.csv) and import it into a database using SQL in SQLite3.

My goal is to update this code with new versions that will expand the program to be able to organize and visualize the data based on user input.

Testing
